# JavaScript Code Challenge - Comments

## Objectives

- DOM Manipulation
- Events and Event Handlers
- Callbacks
- AJAX with `fetch`

## Instructions

We're building out a comment application. A user should be able to create a new comment and add that comment to a `comment list`. The comments list can be filtered via a keyword. The user should also be able to delete a comment. All changes should persist in the database.

## The API

Instead of actually accessing the data from a remote server, this challenge uses a package called [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to create a fake RESTful JSON API for development and testing.

It is very easy to set-up:

1. Run `$ yarn global add json-server`

2. Run `$ json-server --watch db.json` while in the same directory as this challenge.

That's it. You will have a server running on `localhost:3000` that serves the JSON data contained in the `db.json` file.

*Troubleshooting: If this fails, be sure you don't already have something running on port 3000*

## The Available Routes

This server will follow normal RESTful routing conventions and will respond with JSON. The endpoints available to you are listed below:

| HTTP Verb | Endpoint        | Response                  | Required Params                             |
| :-------- | :-------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`     | `/comments`     | all comments              | none                                        |
| `GET`     | `/comments/:id` | a single comment          | comment id in url                           |
| `POST`    | `/comments`     | the newly created comment | `content` key in body                       |
| `PATCH`   | `/comments/:id` | the updated comment       | `content` key in body and comment id in url |
| `DELETE`  | `/comments/:id` | empty object `{}`         | comment id in url                           |


Don't forget to specify the `headers` when sending JSON to the server:

```js
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Accept': 'application/json'
}
```

## Submission

Do not push your changes up to Github. When you finish:

1. If you haven't already, create a custom branch with `git checkout -b custom_branch`.
1. `git add` and `git commit` your changes.
1. From you custom branch, run `git format-patch master --stdout > your_name.patch`, replacing `your_name` with your first and last name.
1. Send the patch file to your instructor on Connect before the specified time. Remember, you can use `open .` to launch a Finder window from your current directory, and then drag your file into Connect.

## Deliverables

### Functionality demo

![Functionality Demo](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/immersive_assessments/module-3/javascript-challenge-comment-maker.gif)

---

- When the page loads, a user should be able to see all of the already existing comments on the page.

- A user should be able to fill out the comment field, submit the form, and see their new comment on the page as a list item. ( **🗝MAJOR KEY ALERT🔑** `json-server` does not have any validations. In case you accidentally create `undefined`, invalid, or empty comments, you can copy the contents of `db-backup.json` into your `db.json` so you can start with valid seed data. )

- Each comment should have a delete button. Sample markup for a comment might look like this:

```html
<li class="list-group-item">
  <span> a sample comment </span>
  <button class="btn btn-danger btn-sm pull-right">Delete</button>
</li>
```

- A user should be able to delete a particular comment by clicking the delete button. These changes should be present in both the DOM and the server.

### BONUS (Nothing like this will be on the actual assessment)

- A user should be able to type a search term into the filter comments input
  - The comments list should **only display comments _containing_ the search term**
  - If the user clears the filter input, all comments should be displayed again.

Good luck!
